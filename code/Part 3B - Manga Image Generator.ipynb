    "- Defined as “the inability to begin or continue writing for reasons other than a lack of basic skill or commitment.”\n",
    "- Personal Experience: Can be very frustrating, caused me sleepless nights when I was affected by it. Can also happen to artists.\n",
    "- Put plainly, it is a sudden lack of motivation which results in writers being unable to continue their work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Storyboarding, and how writer’s block has a negative effect:**\n",
    "- Crucial step where creators plan the visual flow of the story, depicting scenes and panel layouts.\n",
    "- Storyboarding is the bridge between a written script and the final artwork.\n",
    "- Writer's block can extend to storyboarding, where creators struggle to visualize the scenes and transitions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Writer’s Block is prevalent in the manga industry:**\n",
    "- Berserk: Kentaro Miura was known for taking hiatuses due to creative challenges leading to long waits.\n",
    "- Evangelion: Yoshiyuki Sadamoto took multiple hiatuses which were attributed to creative challenges.\n",
    "- Hunter X Hunter: Yoshihiro Togashi, experienced writer's block, leading to year-long hiatuses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creators’ relentless workload is worsening the issue:**\n",
    "- There are many manga creators who end up suffering from their work\n",
    "- Creators work long hours affecting physical or mental health or suffer direct abuse from the system.\n",
    "- Leads to a loss of motivation, inability to produce new ideas, and worsens the problem of writer’s block.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How is AI helping with writer's block?**\n",
    "- ChatGPT is helping to write next instalment of manga hit One Piece as author runs into writer’s block.\n",
    "- “Cyberpunk: Peach John” is the world’s first complete AI manga work.\n",

    "We thus arrive at the following problem statement:\n",

    "- It creates a new white image with the calculated size.\n",
    "- It then iterates over the input images and arranges them in the grid with black borders:\n",
    "- The x and y variables are calculated to determine the position of each image in the grid, considering the image's width, height, and the 10-pixel black border between them.\n",
    "- The resize_and_add_border function is called to resize the input image to the size of the first image (images[0]) and add a 10-pixel black border.\n",

The story begins on a clear, moonlit night. Aiko is on her balcony, observing the constellations with her telescope, as she does every night. Unexpectedly, she spots Hiroshi on his own balcony, staring up at the same moon and stars. Aiko can't help but be captivated by the sight of him lost in thought, his usually charismatic demeanor replaced by something more vulnerable. She realizes that Hiroshi has a hidden love for astronomy as well, a shared passion they've never discussed. Aiko takes a deep breath and gathers her courage, deciding to approach Hiroshi. She sends him a message, asking if he'd like to join her for some stargazing. At first, Hiroshi is taken aback by the message from Aiko, the enigmatic girl from their school who he's admired from afar. However, his curiosity and love for the stars compel him to accept her invitation. As they share the moonlit balcony and gaze at the night sky, Aiko and Hiroshi bond over their shared passion for astronomy. They discuss constellations, the beauty of the cosmos, and their dreams.

    "**SSIM (Structural Similarity Index):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The SSIM scores for the generated panels vary from approximately 0.46 to 0.60.\n",
    "- These scores indicate moderate to strong structural similarity between different panels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The PSNR scores for your generated panels range from around 8.13 to 12.71.\n",
    "- These scores suggest a range of image quality, with some panels having lower image quality and others having higher image quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the SSIM and PSNR scores show that there is a diversity in the quality and structural similarity of the generated panels. Some panels exhibit stronger structural similarity and higher image quality, while others have lower scores, indicating differences in visual patterns and image quality."

    "### Conclusions\n",
    "With this, we have created an image generator to generate a manga strip based on a given scenario. We can now finish the project and answer the problem statement.\n",
    "We have created a way to automated ideation and storyboarding using generative AI tools. These tools can provide several benefits to manga writers and help them overcome writer's block:\n",
    "- **Inspiration and Creativity Boost:** The tool can provide fresh and creative ideas, helping manga writers overcome creative blocks. It can offer novel scenarios, character interactions, and plot twists, sparking new inspiration.\n",
    "- **Overcoming Writer's Block:** Our tool can break the writer's block by providing a starting point. Writers can modify, expand upon, or adapt these prompts to fit their narrative vision.\n",
    "- **Reducing Writer's Stress:** By taking on some of the ideation workload, the tool can reduce the stress and pressure associated with coming up with new story ideas and storyboards on a consistent basis.\n",
    "- **Collaboration:** The generated panels produced by our tool can serve as a starting point for collaboration between writers and artists. Writers can present the generated concepts to artists, who can then refine and visualize them. This is especially a boon to people who like to write, but cannot draw."
